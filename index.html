              <h2>What is Alt Text?</h2>
              <br />
              <p>
                A recent review of Division of Undergraduate Education webpages
                revealed a lack of alternative text, or “alt text”, on images.
                Alt text is a description added to an image to explain its
                content. It is the first step to web accessibility, and we have
                your quick guide for using alt text.
                <br />
                <br />
                Alt text ensures images are accessible, enhances search
                rankings, and provides context when images fail to load.

            <h2>Why is Alt Text Important?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              We get it: it can be tough to keep track of all the ins and outs
              of best practices in the digital sphere. However, there are
              multiple benefits to remembering alt text for your photos.
              <br />
              <br />
              Accessibility. Alt text enables your website to communicate to
              people with disabilities or limited vision by describing images.
              Ignoring alt text creates barriers for people who cannot see
              content on your site and who navigate the site using a screen
              reader.
              <br />
              <br />
              Search Engine Optimization. Search engines like Google scan
              websites for matching words. Describing an image with alt text
              helps search engines make sense of your images and allows your
              page to show up in relevant searches.
              <br />
              <br />
              Connection Issues. Whether a person has images turned off or they
              are experiencing connection issues, alt text will appear when an
              image fails to load.

            <h2>How Do You Use Alt Text Effectively?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              Not all attempts to use alt text are effective. Remember these
              best practices for using alt text. Describe what is shown in the
              photo itself; avoid adding complementary information as a caption
              might. Enter alt text for every image, except decorative images
              that add nothing to the text. Keep it concise; use no more than
              10-15 words. Include any words that appear in informative images.
